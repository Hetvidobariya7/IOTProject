          <h3>LED (Light-Emitting Diode)</h3>
          <img src="image\LED.jpg" alt="Image of LED component">
          <p>
            An LED is a small electronic component that emits light when current flows through it. LEDs come in various colors and are used for indication, illumination, and decoration in circuits.
          </p>

          <h3>PIR Sensor (Passive Infrared Sensor)</h3>
          <img src="image\PIR-SENSOR-MODULE.png" alt="Image of PIR sensor component">
          <p>
            A PIR sensor detects changes in infrared radiation, which is emitted by all objects with a temperature above absolute zero. This makes it useful for motion detection applications.
          </p>
